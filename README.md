# Animal Crossing Project

This is a fan website for the game Animal Crossing.

Aims of the website:

- List every bug, item, fish etc. etc.
- A user can track what bugs, fish, villagers they have caught or have.
  -Users can create "collections" to share with others. A collection can be a wishlist of items, or villagers they wish to have. Or a bunch of items they have available to catalogue with other players and so on and so forth.
- Use graphQL because it is fancy
- Use JWT because it is fancy
